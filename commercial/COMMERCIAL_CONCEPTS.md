## TYPOGRAPHY GUIDELINES

### Primary Headline Font
- **Style:** Condensed, ultra-bold, all caps
- **Reference:** Madden title cards, COD mission text
- **Tracking:** Tight (-20 to -40)
- **Weight:** 900 / Black

### Secondary Text
- **Style:** Clean sans-serif, medium weight
- **Use:** Dates, URLs, supporting info
- **Tracking:** Wider (+50 to +100)

### Number Treatment
- **Style:** Same as headlines but larger
- **Effect:** Slight 3D depth, team color glow
- **Use:** Jersey numbers, countdowns, scores

### Animation Principles
1. **Text enters with PURPOSE** - slam, slide, or fade (never float)
2. **Hold for readability** - minimum 1.5 seconds per text block
3. **Exit cleanly** - cut or quick fade, never slow dissolve
4. **One message at a time** - don't stack competing text

---

## COLOR PALETTE

```
SEAHAWKS NAVY     #002244  (backgrounds, depth)
ACTION GREEN      #69BE28  (accents, CTAs, energy)
WOLF GREY         #A5ACAF  (secondary text)
PURE WHITE        #FFFFFF  (primary text)
GOLD              #FFD700  (giveaway, premium moments)
PURE BLACK        #000000  (contrast, transitions)
```

---

## AUDIO DIRECTION

### Concept A: "The Dark Side Rises"
- Orchestral strings build → electronic drop
- Stadium crowd ambience throughout
- Impact hits on text slams

### Concept B: "Bored? Not Anymore."
- Comedic silence/crickets opening
- Sudden explosion of energy at tap
- Upbeat, fun, celebratory

### Concept C: "11 Defenders. 1 Mission."  
- Military drums, march feel
- Building anthem, pride
- Final triumphant resolution

---

## RECOMMENDED CONCEPT

**Concept A: "The Dark Side Rises"** is the strongest for these reasons:

1. **Immediate hook** - "No football this week" is relatable and timely
2. **Player variety** - Features multiple defenders, not just DeMarcus
3. **Clear escalation** - Builds from tension to explosion to payoff
4. **Clean information hierarchy** - Each beat has ONE purpose
5. **Strong CTA** - URL is unmissable, date is clear
6. **Premium feel** - Matches AAA game trailer quality

However, **Concept B** works best if the target audience is more casual/social media focused, and **Concept C** works best if you want to emphasize team/Seattle pride.
